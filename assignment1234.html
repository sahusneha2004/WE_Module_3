<h1 id="assignment-03-01-through-03-04">Assignment 03-01 through
03-04</h1>
<p>This is a combined documentation of assignments 01 through 04 that
have been semi-formally assigned to you at the end of class. You have
time until 6pm on the 19th of March 2024 to coalesce your submissions
for all four and submit your solutions. Read the instructions carefully
and submit everything required.</p>
<h2 id="assignment-01">Assignment 01</h2>
<p>Pick any non-trivial problem statement from your computational
thinking course and ask genAI to solve it. Iterate upon its solution to
apply our principles of clean code.</p>
<h2 id="assignment-02">Assignment 02</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use a genAI tool to learn what the game of Yahtzee is</li>
<li>Engineer the genAI tool to play Yahtzee with you</li>
<li>Ask the genAI tool how to approach writing code for a Yahtzee scorer
yourself</li>
</ul>
<p>DO NOT ask the genAI tool to write code yet.</p>
<h2 id="assignment-03">Assignment 03</h2>
<p>Create a testing strategy for the Yahtzee scorer code that was
generated and document your journey.</p>
<h2 id="assignment-04">Assignment 04</h2>
<p>The 1980s saw a shift from Natural Language Processing techniques
aiming to codify the grammatical rules of natural language towards
techniques aiming to use statistical models to generate text. One early
idea which technically isn’t “AI” seeing as it is “memorizing” the
training data and yet introduces us to the power contained in
statistical techniques of text generation is the idea of Markov chains.
Write a python function
<code>generate(filename: str, start_words: list[str], chain_length: int, num_generated: int) -&gt; str</code>
which takes a filename, a chain length, a list of start words which has
to be exactly as long as the <code>chain_length</code> (why?), and an
integer <code>num_generated</code> and returns a sentence
<code>num_generated</code> words long which sounds similar to the text
contained in <code>filename</code>.</p>
<h2 id="mode-of-submission">Mode of submission</h2>
<p>There are three components to this submission, all necessary:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A document (markdown/google doc) containing a transcript of your
conversation with genAI</li>
<li>A colab notebook containing your final version of the code, properly
working and execution demonstrated (i.e. actually run the code for a
couple of test cases and save the colab notebook that way)</li>
<li>A git repo where you’re keeping track of your progress this module.
It should ideally be in
<code>https://gitlab.com/&lt;your name&gt;/WE-Module3</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Create a zipped folder with the following files:</p>
<pre><code>|---genai-transcripts.csv
|---colab-links.csv
|---git-link.txt</code></pre>
<p>Each csv file should have the format
<code>assignment_number, hyperlink</code>. The git-link.txt should only
contain a link to your git repo.</p>
<p>The LMS will contain space to upload exactly one zip file.</p>
<h2 id="dont-panic">Don’t panic</h2>
<p>If you have done the work on or soon after the day it was given, you
should have all these documents ready, just scattered around. The
intention of this assignment is to get all the scattered documents in
order and put them all in a trackable git repo. I predict that this will
take two hours on a weekend afternoon to do. Don’t procrastinate this
further; trust me when I say this will be useful.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<p>Evaluation is binary. For every one of the assignments you have put
in a meaningful effort and submitted original work, you get 1 mark. If
you have plagiarized or you seem to be uncritically satisfied with the
first bit of code that got generated, or of course, if you haven’t
submitted, you get 0 marks. There is a 1 mark bonus for finishing all
four, giving you 5 marks total.</p>
